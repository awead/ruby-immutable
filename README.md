Sample exercises for learning immutabiltiy in Ruby.

These are based on the [Learning Scala by Building Scala](https://mauricio.github.io/2013/12/08/learning-scala-by-building-scala-lists-part-2.html) blog posts.

Try to implement these functions without mutable state:

Easiest
* reverse an array
* implement count for an array

Intermediate
* implement take and drop for array
* implement include? on array (find)

Harder (will need blocks, procs, or lambdas)

* implement select on array (filter)
* implement map on an array
